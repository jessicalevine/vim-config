# vim-config
This is my lightsaber. I have built it by my own hand, and with it I create, and I destroy. It inherits from the knowledge of many before me. I place it here for today's padawans to learn as I did. Use it well.

## Install
```
git clone git@github.com:mrjordangoldstein/vim-config.git
sh install.sh
```
